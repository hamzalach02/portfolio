## Overview

You have created a web application using React for the front end and Spring Boot for the back end, implementing JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. This application allows users to authenticate, create job offers, and express interest in job offers. Users have detailed profiles including email, password, full name, website, birthdate, job title, education degree, and skills. Job offer creators can view profiles of users interested in their job offers, enabling effective candidate tracking.

### Features

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Secure JWT authentication for user login and session management.
   - Detailed user profiles with personal information and skills.

2. **Job Offer Management**:
   - Creation of job offers with titles and descriptions.
   - User ability to express interest in job offers.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - Job offer creators can view profiles of users interested in their offers.

## Architecture

The application architecture includes:

- **Front End**: Developed with React for responsive and interactive user interfaces.
- **Back End**: Built on Spring Boot to handle business logic, API endpoints, and database interactions.
- **JWT Authentication**: Ensures secure user sessions and protects API endpoints.
